- Follow modern UI design principles with clean, accessible interfaces.
- Use Shadcn UI components for forms, dialogs, tables, and navigation.
- Implement dark mode support using Tailwind's dark mode utilities.

- Ensure all UI components are accessible (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
- Create consistent UI patterns across the application.
- Use CSS variables for theming when appropriate.
