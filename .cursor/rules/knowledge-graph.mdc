Knowledge Graph Implementation
- Use D3.js for relationship visualization, wrapped in React components.
- Implement proper graph navigation tools (zoom, pan, filter).
- Show relationship strength with line thickness proportional to strength.
- Use dashed green lines for distinct relationships.
- Implement parent-child relationship detection based on naming conventions.
- Add directional arrows to show relationship direction.
- Create explicit visual representation with special hierarchy links.
- Provide visual context for relationships with tooltips and highlights.
- Ensure relationship visualization is interactive and informative.
- Implement proper performance optimizations for large graphs.
