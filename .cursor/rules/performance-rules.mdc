Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'useState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Use React.memo for expensive render components.
- Implement virtualization for large lists and tables.
- Cache expensive calculations with useMemo.
- Use incremental static regeneration for semi-static pages.
- Optimize bundle size with proper code splitting.
- Minimize client-side JavaScript when possible.
