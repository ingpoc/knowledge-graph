# AI Agent MCP Implementation
## Product Requirements Document

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to persist, query, and manipulate knowledge about codebases across multiple projects and sessions. The primary goal is to overcome the context limitations of AI assistants by providing a structured knowledge graph that maintains relationships between code components, features, and other entities.

---

## 2. Product Vision

### Core Purpose
Build a Next.js-based MCP server that enables AI agents to:
- Store and retrieve contextual knowledge about large codebases
- Maintain project boundaries while allowing cross-project insights
- Provide users with visibility into the AI's accumulated knowledge
- Create a self-improving system where each interaction enhances the knowledge graph

### Success Metrics
- Reduced repetition in AI-user interactions about codebase structure
- Improved accuracy in AI suggestions due to expanded contextual awareness
- User engagement with the knowledge graph visualization
- Effective knowledge persistence across multiple sessions

---

## 3. User Personas

### Developer (Alex)
- Works with multiple codebases
- Needs AI assistance that understands project context
- Wants to avoid repeating explanations about code structure
- Values accurate and contextually aware AI suggestions

### AI Agent (Claude)
- Has limited context window in each interaction
- Needs access to previously gathered knowledge
- Must store and retrieve structured information about code
- Should continuously update and refine its understanding

### Project Manager (Jordan)
- Needs visibility into what the AI understands about projects
- Wants to ensure AI has accurate knowledge of system architecture
- Requires visualization of component relationships
- May need to correct or augment AI's understanding
